# Estimating Time
* You have to always keep a log for the previous work you have done and how long it took you to do it.
* because this will help you in estimating the time for the next work you will do.
* and this will help you in planning your time.
* moreover, if you are asked to do a similar task but on larger scale, you can just multiply the time needed for this tasks by the scale of the new task.
* for example, if you are asked to do a task that is 3 times larger than the previous task, then you can just multiply the time needed for the previous task by 3.
