# How to be the most productive person in the room. 
> It is all about prioritization.
* you have to avoid distractions. 
* then the things that have to be done and have a close deadline, they should be done first. 
* **The Stuff you need to finish first gets finished on time, and then you can move on to less urgent tasks**
* do not let the pop up tasks distract you from the main tasks.
* and if somebody asked you for a meeting, and you have tasks to be done, you can politely say no, and ask for a different time.
