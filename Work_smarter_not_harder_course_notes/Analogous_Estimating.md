# Analogous Estimating
* Let’s take a look at a few things that can make a big impact on your ability to manage your time and your productivity. Here are a few examples: 

    * Correctly estimating how long it will take for you to complete your work

    * Managing communications more effectively

    * Appreciating the value of organization

    * Understanding your most and least productive times of the day

* Let’s start with estimating. We have already covered the importance of having your own plan, having clear priorities, and having a realistic understanding of how you really spend your time. Central to all of this is the ability to make good estimates.

* When we discussed Sam and the work he needed to complete that Friday afternoon, we noticed that he had estimates for how long each item was going to take him. How did he know? Remember, the best estimates come from experience. Sam created a status report every week and it usually took him 30 minutes. The special report that he was creating for his manager was similar to another report that he had created previously and he knew how long it would take. You can see that it really pays to keep a log of the work you do and how long it takes to do it. The next time you have to do something similar, you won’t have to guess how long it will take. 

* You might create a log or a table and keep track of the following information:

    * The name of the task

    * A description of the work it requires

    * Your initial time estimate

    * The actual time to complete it

    * The variance or difference between the estimated and the actual time

    * Notes/comments capturing reasons for the variance

* If you do not have an initial estimate, ask a subject matter expert. If you are the subject matter expert, conduct some research. Look up the task online or see if there are any records that exist from the last time someone else in your role performed it. For specialized work, you might be able to find data or compare it to work that is similar in nature and then update your estimate based on the differences.

>This approach is called analogous estimating

# Parametric Estimating
* For example, suppose that you routinely create a quarterly customer analysis report. Now you’re asked to create a similar report that covers only a month’s worth of data rather than three months’ worth. The monthly version requires the same number of steps as the quarterly version, so your time estimate for the monthly report assumes that you’ll follow the same steps but include only a month’s worth of data.

* How would you estimate a task that is somewhat repetitive, such as validating data? Assume that you know it takes about 15 minutes to validate one month of data, so to estimate the time needed to validate three months of data, you would multiply 15 minutes by three, for a total of 45 minutes. Specifically,

* Data Validation Time = (15 minutes) x (number of months of data being validated)

	* = 15 minutes x 3

	* = 45 minutes

> This process is called parametric estimating. Be sure to write this formula down in your estimating table so you can refer back to it.
