# Task Prioritization
* always remember that you have things you need to do and might put you in trouble if you did not do them.
* and things you want to do that are not super urgent and will cause no damge if you did not do them.
* you always have to focus on two main times: 
  * the Due time: which is the time on which you have to submit the task. 
  * the Estimation time: which is your estimation of the time you need to finish the task.
  * keep in mind that the estimation time is not always accurate and you might need more time to finish the task.
* then you have to categorize the tasks into:
  * need category: which is a category that contains the tasks that you have to do and you have to do them on time, and they have the highest priority on your task list.
  * may be later category: which is a category that contains the tasks that you want to do but you can do them later, and they have the less priority on your task list.
  * Each day, it is important to know what you need to accomplish and what you want to accomplish. What you need to accomplish is the priority. What you want to accomplish can be additional work you perform after your priorities are met. For Sam, completing the two reports for his boss was what he needed to accomplish—the reports were his priority. After that came the emails and finally, with whatever time he had remaining, perhaps researching the sales numbers. Why “perhaps?” The sales numbers were not due until the following Thursday and it is very likely that Sam had other deadlines before Thursday.
