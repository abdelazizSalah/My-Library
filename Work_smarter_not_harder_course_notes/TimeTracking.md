# Time Tracking
* you need to track where do you spend your time. 
* so you can write down what do you do every 2 hours (they said 30-mins but I feel like this is too small period of time).
* be honest with yourself, if you spent 2 hours on youtube, write it down.
* after you do this, you will figure out what are your time wasters!, and you can cut them off.

* If you want to meet your work goals and have a life, you need to prioritize.
