# Plan Your Time
* The plan is as good as what goes into it. 
* you have to always have a plan for your time.
* so you have to have a task list in which you insert your tasks and categorize them.
* and not only inserting the task, but also you have to organize them by: 
  * 1. Priority: which is the importance of the task.
  * 2. Due date: which is the date on which you have to submit the task.
  * 3. Steps that need to be taken to complete the task.
  * 4. Start date: which is the date on which you have to start the task.
  * 5. Who it is for: which is the person who will receive the task.
  * 6. How long it will take: which is the time you need to finish the task.
  * 7. What you need to complete the work: which is the tools you need to finish the task.
* If you have not done a certain task or type of work before, you might not know how long it will take. That's completely normal. The best way to find out is to ask! Review your job responsibilities and ask someone who is in the same role or who has previously done that job. Keep good notes and keep track of how long something takes you so that you have a solid estimate that you can use in the future.
* How do you know what your priorities are? Depending on the type of work you do, your priorities come to you from your leadership or perhaps from a customer you are supporting. It's important to really understand the priorities you are expected to meet.
