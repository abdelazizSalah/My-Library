* You have to determine which type of people are you:
  * Larks: People who are more productive in the morning.
  * Owls: People who are more productive in the evening.
  * Third Birds: People who are more productive in the afternoon.
* to be able to determine it you have to ask your self 3 questions:
  * When do you wake up?
  * When do you go to sleep?
  * what is the midpoint between the two?
* all of them should be calculated for a free day, when you do not have to wake up early. 
* if your midpoint was before 3:30 am, then you are a Lark.
* else if your midpoint was after 5:30 am, then you are an Owl.
* anything else you are a Third Bird. (most of us)
* also we all fall in certain pattern except the owls. 
* peak --> Trough --> recovery
* at the peak, we are more productive, and we should do the analytical tasks.
* at the trough, we are less productive, and we should do the administrative tasks.
* while at the recovery, we are more open to ideas so we can have a brainstorming.
* avoid having meeting in early morning because this will waste your focus mode. 
* other wise let the meetings be in the middle of the day. 
* the owls are in the reverse pattern:
  * recovery --> trough --> peak
