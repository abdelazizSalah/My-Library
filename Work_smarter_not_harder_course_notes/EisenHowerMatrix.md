# EisenHower Matrix
* it is a method to prioritize your tasks
* it is a 2x2 matrix, with 4 quadrants
* the quadrants are:
    * Urgent and Important
    * Not Urgent and Important
    * Urgent and Not Important
    * Not Urgent and Not Important
* the first quadrant is the most important one, and the last one is the least important one.
* the first quadrant is the one that you should focus on, and the last one is the one that you should avoid.
* used to sort our tasks. 
* examples on each quad: 
  * Urgent and Important: 
    * a deadline that is coming up
    * a meeting that you have to attend
    * a task that you have to do for your boss
  * Urgent and Not Important: 
    * a meeting that you don't have to attend
    * someone who called you to meet him today.
  * Important but not urgent: 
    * a task that may give you a great value, but you do not have to do it right a way.
    * such as going to the gym. 
    * or investing in your self.
    * reading books. 
    * this is the best category for self improvement.
  * Neither Urgent nor Important: 
    * watching TV
    * playing video games
    * scrolling through social media
    * this is the worst category for self improvement.

* so always try to live in the important but not urgent quadrant.
* and avoid as much as you can the neither urgent nor important quadrant.
