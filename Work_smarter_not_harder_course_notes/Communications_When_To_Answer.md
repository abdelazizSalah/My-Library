# Communications: When to Answer, When to Wait

There is no doubt about it, communication takes time—but it's time well spent. It also could be an area where you can improve your effectiveness and productivity. Maybe you’ve had days where you felt like all you did was answer texts, messages, emails, and even voicemails. To be productive, however, it pays to have an approach for handling your communications.

Most of us want to read every text message or email as soon as it arrives. We hear that beep or buzz and we just have to know what it says. But do you really have to know? While there are times when you are on call for a specific project or issue, or as a parent you want to stay in touch with your children, aside from a few high-priority situations and individuals, some things can and should wait. For instance, you can easily lose an hour or more texting your friends about weekend plans, but those texts can wait until after the workday (and also after dinner with your family).

If you can, try not to look at your messages every time a new one arrives. Try to set up a specific time—or times—during your workday to handle these communications. And if your work environment doesn't allow you to do this, at least try to avoid looking up every time a new message arrives. Wait until you have several of them stacked up, review them, and then go back to your work. David Allen, the productivity guru and author of Getting Things Done, recommends these criteria for determining what to do:

    If the message you receive is informational and you think you should keep it, then e-file it. If the message you receive does not require any actions from you and you do not need to take any action, delete it.

    If the message you receive does require action on your part and you can take care of it in less than two minutes, do it.

    If the message does require you to take action and that action will take more than two minutes, flag it for action or place it in a “take action” e-folder. Make sure that you place this item on your task list and if it has a due date, consider placing it on your calendar too. 

    Have a flag or e-folder for items where you are waiting for someone else to respond to you.

    Have clearly marked folders or use a color-coding system that makes sense for you. For example, I have red flags for required follow-up, green flags for client communications that I am saving, and orange flags for student communications that I am saving. I set aside time in my work schedule to handle red-flag items so I don’t overlook them. 

Let’s take a look at a few examples to see how this might work. 

You’re working on your computer and suddenly a message arrives—it's a request for a specific document. You have a copy of that document on your computer and know exactly where it is stored. What do you do? Since you can fulfill this request in two minutes or less, simply do it!

Not long afterward, an announcement about a new payroll policy pops up in your email. You don't need to do anything about it because the announcement is purely informational. In this situation, you should file the message in case you want to refer to it later. 

Next, you receive a request for a special report that's due in one week and you estimate that it will take about 30 minutes to complete it. Since this task is actionable but can’t be completed in less than two minutes, you place the request in a special “action” folder and then add it to both your work plan and your calendar so you don’t forget it.

Finally, you open a message from a coworker regarding some information you requested. She says that she will respond to you by Friday. You place the message in your “pending” or “follow-up” folder, and add a note to your calendar for Friday to remind you to look for the information at that time.

When you organize communications as they come to you, you take control of your time and your effectiveness. For more, be sure to read the item this week on how effective internal communication can boost employee productivity.
