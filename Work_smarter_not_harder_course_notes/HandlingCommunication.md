# Handling Communication
* the video was disscussing a problem.
* the problem is when you have a lot of messages one after the other and you already have certain tasks to do.
* such as you mom sent you message asking for something. 
* and your boss has sent you an email asking for something.
* and then your colleague sent you to do certain thing. 
* so now what should you do? 
* if you kept just answering the pop up notifications or the pop up messages, then you will have nothing done at the end of the day. 
* so what you should do is to just focus on what you are doing, and you may check your phone every 2 hrs, and when you read these messages, you have to prioritize them, if there is something urgent, it's okay to do it and respond quickly, otherwise, make a reminder to response after you finish what you are doing.
