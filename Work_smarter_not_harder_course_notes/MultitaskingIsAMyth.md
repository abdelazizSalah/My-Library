# Multitasking is a Myth
* To do two things at once though, is to do neither. 
* Needless to say, switching from one task to another takes time as you have to remember the last thing you did and then refocus your thinking on what you need to do next. This lost time is called a switching cost.
* The more times you start and stop, and then restart a task, the more time you lose. 
* “People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task. The thicker the residue, the worse the performance” (Leroy, 2009).
* When you have a choice, make an effort to work on one thing at a time. When you are writing, just write. When you're talking on the phone, turn your back to your computer and just talk. The end result is that you will be more productive and feel less fragmented, and you will make fewer mistakes.
